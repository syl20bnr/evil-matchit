* evil-matchit (current version 1.0.0)

Vim [[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=39][matchit.vim]] by Benji Fisher ported into Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'evil-matchit)
(global-evil-matchit-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, you can enable evil-matchit-mode along a major mode by adding `turn-on-evil-matchit-mode' to the mode hook.

*This package uses Evil as its vi layer*!

* Install
evil-matchit is already uploaded to [[http://marmalade-repo.org/]]. So the best way to install it is using Emacs' package manager.

* How to use evil-matchit
Press "%" to jump inside item(s) between tags in evil-normal-mode whose command name is "evilmi-jump-items".

Press ",si" to select item(s) wrapped by tags in evil-normal-mode whose command name is "evilmi-select-items".

Press ",di" to delete item(s) wrapped by tags in evil-normal-mode whose command name is "evilmi-delete-items".

All commands support numeric argument like "3%", "5,si" or "9,di"

* Advanced set up
** Support more major modes
html tags are automatically supported in nxml-mode, web-mode, html-mode and nxhtml-mode.

Add below line into ~/.emacs to support more major modes:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq evilmi-html-major-modes '(nxml-mode web-mode html-mode nxhtml-mode php-mode jsp-mode))
#+END_SRC

** re-define keybinding
You can define your own key bindings instead using evil-matchit default key binding.

All you need to do is define function evilmi-customize-keybinding before turning on evil-mathcit-mode:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun evilmi-customize-keybinding ()
  (evil-define-key 'normal evil-matchit-mode-map
    "%" 'evilmi-jump-items
    ",si" 'evilmi-select-items
    ",di" 'evilmi-delete-items
    )
  )
(global-evil-matchit-mode 1)
#+END_SRC
